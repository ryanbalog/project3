## Purpose:
Project Doc: "To write an application which stores the courses taken by a student and prints out areport. Data will be read from a data.txt file. Once all data has been read from the data.txt file, your program should print a report. After the list of courses has been printed, you should then calculate and display the cumulative GPA of all courses in the list."

course.py, courselist.py, and main.py are my own work, all other files were provided.

## Method:
- Create Node and Linked List classes
- Store ingested data in a Linked List object
- Use methods in linked list object to output main.py
- Pass all provided unit tests
